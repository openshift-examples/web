The OpenShift Examples is a personal collection of valuable information, code snippets, and practical demonstrations related to OpenShift and Kubernetes. It serves as a repository of Robert's own experiences & contributions, solutions, and best practices in managing and deploying applications on OpenShift.

They foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the OpenShift community,
making the repository even more valuable as a collective resource.
