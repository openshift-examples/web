You: The route is not available. Why?

OpenShift Lightspeed: The Route `fixme` is not functional because the associated Service `fixme` has a selector `app=fixmy`, but no Pods matching this label exist in the `fixme` namespace. Ensure Pods with the correct label (`app=fixmy`) are running to resolve the issue.
